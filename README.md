# Overview

The purpose of this set of code is to demonstrate my ability to print "Hello World" using python.

The software when run prints "Hello World" to the terminal.

The purpose of creating this software is to add it to add it to my five sectioned portfolio demonstrating my ability to create functional coding with no errors.

Below is a short video demonstration of the code.
